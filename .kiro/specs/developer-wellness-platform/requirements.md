#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer connects wearable devices THEN the system SHALL integrate with popular fitness trackers (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin) to collect heart rate, stress, and activity data
2. WHEN biometric data indicates elevated stress levels THEN the system SHALL trigger wellness alerts with personalized intervention suggestions within 30 seconds
3. WHEN prolonged periods of inactivity are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend movement breaks with specific exercises tailored to desk workers
4. WHEN sleep patterns affect productivity metrics THEN the system SHALL correlate sleep quality with coding performance and suggest schedule optimizations
5. WHEN biometric trends show burnout risk indicators THEN the system SHALL escalate to team leads with anonymized wellness reports and intervention recommendations

### Requirement 2: Multi-Modal Wellness Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with wellness features through voice commands, gestures, and traditional interfaces, so that I can maintain focus while accessing wellness support without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer speaks wellness commands THEN the system SHALL recognize voice patterns with 95% accuracy for actions like "start focus session", "take break", or "check wellness status"
2. WHEN using touch-enabled devices THEN the system SHALL respond to gesture controls for quick wellness actions (swipe for break timer, pinch for stress check)
3. WHEN in deep focus mode THEN the system SHALL use ambient visual cues and haptic feedback to communicate wellness suggestions without audio interruption
4. WHEN accessibility needs are detected THEN the system SHALL adapt interaction methods to support developers with different physical capabilities
5. WHEN voice commands are used in open office environments THEN the system SHALL provide whisper-mode recognition and silent feedback options

### Requirement 3: Proactive Wellness Intelligence

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want AI-powered wellness insights that predict team burnout risks and suggest preventive interventions, so that I can maintain team health and sustainable productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing team wellness patterns THEN the system SHALL predict burnout risk with 85% accuracy using machine learning models trained on productivity and biometric data
2. WHEN wellness risks are identified THEN the system SHALL generate personalized intervention recommendations based on individual wellness profiles and preferences
3. WHEN team wellness trends decline THEN the system SHALL suggest workload redistribution, schedule adjustments, or team building activities
4. WHEN positive wellness patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL identify and recommend successful practices to other team members
5. WHEN wellness interventions are implemented THEN the system SHALL track effectiveness and adapt recommendations based on outcomes

### Requirement 4: Contextual Wellness Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want wellness analytics that understand my work context and provide relevant insights about how my wellness affects my coding performance, so that I can optimize both my health and productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN correlating wellness with productivity THEN the system SHALL identify personal patterns between stress levels, sleep quality, and coding performance
2. WHEN analyzing work sessions THEN the system SHALL provide wellness-adjusted productivity metrics that account for sustainable work practices
3. WHEN reviewing historical data THEN the system SHALL show how wellness interventions impacted both health indicators and work quality
4. WHEN comparing team wellness THEN the system SHALL provide anonymized benchmarks while maintaining individual privacy
5. WHEN wellness goals are set THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide motivational feedback aligned with both wellness and productivity objectives

### Requirement 5: Enterprise Wellness Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want wellness monitoring that meets regulatory requirements for employee health and safety, so that our organization can demonstrate duty of care while respecting privacy rights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting wellness data THEN the system SHALL comply with HIPAA, GDPR, and occupational health regulations with explicit consent mechanisms
2. WHEN generating wellness reports THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated insights for management while maintaining individual anonymization
3. WHEN wellness incidents occur THEN the system SHALL create audit trails for compliance reporting without exposing personal health information
4. WHEN integrating with HR systems THEN the system SHALL support wellness program tracking and ROI measurement for employee health initiatives
5. WHEN employees opt out THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality while respecting wellness data privacy preferences

### Requirement 6: Wellness-Focused Productivity Insights

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want productivity insights that prioritize sustainable development practices over pure output metrics, so that I can make decisions that support long-term team health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring team productivity THEN the system SHALL weight metrics based on wellness sustainability rather than pure output volume
2. WHEN planning sprints THEN the system SHALL factor in team wellness capacity and suggest realistic workload distribution
3. WHEN evaluating performance THEN the system SHALL highlight developers who maintain high productivity with good wellness practices as positive examples
4. WHEN identifying productivity bottlenecks THEN the system SHALL distinguish between skill gaps and wellness-related performance issues
5. WHEN setting team goals THEN the system SHALL recommend targets that balance delivery objectives with wellness sustainability

### Requirement 7: Integrated Wellness Ecosystem

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between wellness monitoring and my existing development tools, so that wellness becomes a natural part of my workflow rather than an additional burden.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working in IDEs THEN the system SHALL display wellness indicators in the status bar with minimal visual distraction
2. WHEN wellness breaks are recommended THEN the system SHALL integrate with calendar applications to schedule appropriate break times
3. WHEN using project management tools THEN the system SHALL surface wellness considerations in task planning and estimation
4. WHEN participating in code reviews THEN the system SHALL consider reviewer wellness state and suggest optimal review timing
5. WHEN wellness data indicates optimal performance windows THEN the system SHALL suggest scheduling important tasks during peak wellness periods

### Requirement 8: Personalized Wellness Interventions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want personalized wellness interventions that adapt to my individual health patterns, work style, and preferences, so that wellness support feels relevant and effective rather than generic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wellness patterns are established THEN the system SHALL create personalized intervention strategies based on individual response to different wellness activities
2. WHEN stress indicators spike THEN the system SHALL offer customized stress reduction techniques (breathing exercises, music, lighting adjustments)
3. WHEN energy levels fluctuate THEN the system SHALL suggest personalized nutrition, hydration, or movement recommendations
4. WHEN wellness goals are not met THEN the system SHALL adapt intervention strategies and suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN wellness improvements are achieved THEN the system SHALL reinforce successful patterns and suggest ways to maintain progress
