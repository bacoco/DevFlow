# Disaster Recovery System

This directory contains the comprehensive disaster recovery implementation for DevFlow Intelligence, providing automated backup procedures, cross-region data replication, and disaster recovery capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The disaster recovery system consists of several key components:

- **Backup Manager**: Automated backup procedures for all data stores
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Real-time data synchronization across regions
- **Disaster Recovery Manager**: Failover orchestration and recovery planning
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for DR operations
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Automated scheduling and resource management

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Configuration

Copy the example configuration and customize for your environment:

```bash
cp deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-config.example.json deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-config.json
```

Edit `dr-config.json` with your specific settings:
- Database connection strings
- AWS S3 credentials for backup storage
- Region configurations
- Notification settings

### 2. Deploy Kubernetes Resources

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/backup-cronjobs.yaml
```

This creates:
- Daily full backup CronJob
- Hourly incremental backup CronJob
- Weekly backup cleanup CronJob
- Monthly disaster recovery test CronJob

### 3. Test the System

```bash
# Check system status
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status

# Run comprehensive DR test
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js test

# Perform manual backup
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js backup --type full
```
