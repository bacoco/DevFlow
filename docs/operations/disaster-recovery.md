## 📋 Components

### 1. Backup Manager
Automated backup procedures for all data stores:

**Features:**
- Daily full backups at 2 AM UTC
- Hourly incremental backups
- AES-256 encryption with AWS KMS
- Configurable retention policies
- Multi-database support (MongoDB, InfluxDB, Redis)

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "backup": {
    "retention": {
      "daily": 7,
      "weekly": 4,
      "monthly": 12
    },
    "encryption": {
      "enabled": true,
      "keyId": "aws-kms-key-id"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Cross-Region Replication
Real-time data synchronization across regions:

**Features:**
- Continuous data replication
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Health monitoring and lag detection
- Automatic failover capabilities

**Supported Strategies:**
- `last-write-wins`: Latest timestamp wins
- `manual`: Manual conflict resolution
- `timestamp-based`: Timestamp-based resolution

### 3. Disaster Recovery Manager
Orchestrates failover and recovery operations:

**Features:**
- Automated failover based on health checks
- Recovery plan generation and execution
- RTO/RPO compliance monitoring
- Rollback capabilities

### 4. CLI Management Tool
Command-line interface for DR operations:

```bash
# Check system status
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status

# Perform backup
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js backup --type full

# Initiate failover
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js failover us-west-2

# Run DR tests
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js test
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Configuration

Copy and customize the configuration:
```bash
cp deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-config.example.json deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-config.json
```

Edit the configuration with your environment settings:
```json
{
  "disasterRecovery": {
    "backup": {
      "mongodb": {
        "url": "mongodb://mongodb:27017",
        "database": "devflow"
      },
      "storage": {
        "type": "s3",
        "config": {
          "bucket": "devflow-backups",
          "region": "us-east-1"
        }
      }
    },
    "recovery": {
      "rto": 30,
      "rpo": 5,
      "autoFailover": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Deploy Kubernetes Resources

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/backup-cronjobs.yaml
```

This creates:
- Daily full backup CronJob
- Hourly incremental backup CronJob
- Weekly backup cleanup CronJob
- Monthly disaster recovery test CronJob

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check system status
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status

# Run validation tests
node deployment/__tests__/dr-comprehensive-validation.js
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Status

## 🔄 Backup Operations

### Manual Backup

```bash
# Full backup
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js backup --type full

# Incremental backup
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js backup --type incremental
```

### Automated Backup Schedule

| Type | Schedule | Retention | Description |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Full | Daily 2 AM UTC | 7 days | Complete database snapshot |
| Incremental | Hourly | 24 hours | Changed data only |
| Cleanup | Weekly | N/A | Remove old backups |

### Backup Validation

```bash
# Validate backup integrity
node deployment/__tests__/dr-implementation-test.js

# Test backup restoration
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js test --type backup
```

## 🌍 Cross-Region Replication

### Starting Replication

```bash
# Start cross-region replication
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js replication start

# Check replication status
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status
```

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur:

```bash
# List conflicts
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status

# Resolve conflict (use source data)
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js resolve-conflict conflict-123 source

# Resolve conflict (use target data)
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js resolve-conflict conflict-123 target

# Resolve conflict (custom data)
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js resolve-conflict conflict-123 '{"id":"123","name":"resolved"}'
```

### Health Monitoring

Replication health is monitored continuously:
- **Healthy**: Lag < 1 minute, no errors
- **Degraded**: Lag 1-5 minutes, minor issues
- **Failed**: Lag > 5 minutes or connection errors

## 🚨 Failover Operations

### Automatic Failover

Automatic failover triggers when:
- Primary region health check fails
- Replication lag exceeds RPO threshold
- Database connectivity issues
- Application service failures

### Manual Failover

```bash
# Initiate failover to us-west-2
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js failover us-west-2 --reason "Planned maintenance"

# Check failover status
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js status
```

### Failover Process

1. **Validation**: Check target region health
2. **Traffic Stop**: Stop traffic to current region
3. **Promotion**: Promote target region to primary
4. **DNS Update**: Update traffic routing
5. **Verification**: Verify failover success
6. **Notification**: Send alerts to team

## 🔧 Recovery Operations

### Recovery Plan Creation

```bash
# Create full recovery plan
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js recover full --target-region us-west-2

# Create point-in-time recovery plan
node deployment/disaster-recovery/dr-cli.js recover point-in-time --point-in-time "2024-01-27T10:00:00Z"
```

### Recovery Plan Execution

The CLI will show the recovery plan and ask for confirmation:

```
📋 Recovery Plan Created:
  Plan ID: recovery-1706349600-abc123
  Type: full
  Target Region: us-west-2
  Estimated Duration: 25m 30s
  Steps: 4

  1. Restore Databases:
     Description: Restore all databases from backup
     Type: database
     Duration: 30m 0s
     Dependencies: None

  2. Deploy Applications:
     Description: Deploy application services
     Type: application
     Duration: 10m 0s
     Dependencies: Restore Databases

Do you want to execute this recovery plan? (yes/no):
```

### Recovery Steps

1. **Database Restoration**: Restore from latest backup
2. **Application Deployment**: Deploy services to target region
3. **Network Configuration**: Configure load balancers and DNS
4. **Validation**: Run health checks and smoke tests

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

validator.generateComplianceReport().then(report => console.log(report));
"
```
